# JavaTaskTinff
There is the solution of the task from Tinff.
At first I get the number t from input. This t means a number of words with length of 4 symbols.
Then I get all t words from input and put it to the array of String.
The next step is to take 1 word from array of String and put it to the array of char. 
Then in the cycle I make a check, if the first 2 symbols and second 2 symbols are the same.
At the end system writes "YES" if the word consists of the same symbols in the both part of it,
and "NO" if it is not.
